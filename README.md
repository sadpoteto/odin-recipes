This is the first proper project assignment in TOP, it consists of  a basic website
presenting recipes. As CSS has not yet been covered in the curriculum, it's no design
award contender, but is still perfectly functional as-is.

The completion of this project demonstrates the following skills:
* Basic HTML knowledge:
  - Proper syntax, boilerplate and knowledge of good practice
  - Understanding of use cases for <ol> and <ul> (and <li>, of course)
  - Ability to connect pages with links using the <a> tag
  - Ability to properly embed images in pages with <img>
