        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Risotto, a unambiguously italian way to eat rice, by drenching it in broth and cheese.
            The addition of mushrooms greatly boosts the umami content, making for a decadent and creamy dish that pairs well with most
            meats (and wine, of course). Great as both a main or side dish at any italian-themed dinner party.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>6 cups</strong> chicken broth</li>
            <li><strong>3 tbsp</strong> olive oil</li>
            <li><strong>1 lb</strong> sliced portobello mushrooms</li>
            <li><strong>1 lb</strong> sliced white mushrooms</li>
            <li><strong>1.5 cups</strong> Arborio rice</li>
            <li><strong>0.5 cups</strong> dry white wine</li>
            <li><strong>4 tbsp</strong> butter</li>
            <li><strong>3 tbsp</strong> chopped chives</li>
            <li><strong>0.33 cups</strong> grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>salt and pepper <strong>to taste</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the broth in a saucepan, heat on low</li>
            <li>
                Put 2 tbsp of olive oil in a large saucepan, heat on med-high.
                Add mushrooms and cook until soft, stirring often.
                Once done, set aside in a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the remaining olive oil to the pan, cook shallots for 1 minute
                while stirring. Add rice, keep stirring and cook until golden.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir constantly while adding wine, keep stirring until it is fully absorbed.
                Add 0.5 cups of warm broth and repeat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep adding broth in 0.5 cup increments until the rice is tender yet still firm,
                this should take 15-20 mins.
